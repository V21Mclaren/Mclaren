       <p>The McLaren GT is powered by a 4.0L twin-turbocharged V8 engine, producing 620 horsepower, enabling it to accelerate from 0-60 mph in just 3.1 seconds.

       <p>The exterior styling of the McLaren GT blends performance-driven aerodynamics with refined grand touring design.

Features such as a retractable rear spoiler, flush door handles, and advanced aerodynamics contribute to both style and performance.<p>

<p>McLaren has leveraged its carbon-fiber Monocell II-T monocoque chassis to optimize interior space, providing a comfortable yet driver-focused cockpit. The GT's elongated proportions and rear-mid-engine layout are engineered to offer a perfect balance of driving dynamics and practicality</p>
